# SigmaDsl: Scala DSL for smart contracts with zero knowledge proof of knowledge  

## Intro
 SigmaDsl is a domain-specific language embedded into Scala and designed to be
 source code compatible with SigmaScript. This means you can write SigmaDsl
 code directly in Scala IDE (e.g. IntelliJ IDEA) and copy-paste code snippets
 between SigmaDsl and SigmaScript.
 Special Scala macros can also be used to automatically translate SigmaDsl to 
 Sigma byte code. Some prototype has been implemented [here](https://github.com/ergoplatform/ergo-scala-compiler)
